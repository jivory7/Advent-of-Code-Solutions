# Advent-of-Code-Solutions

Here you'll find my solutions to some Advent of Code problems from 2022 and 2016. Those from 2016 are explicitly labeled (sorry about the poor naming conventions!).

The prompts for each problem can be found at https://adventofcode.com/, and are sorted there by year. Each participant is given a unique input for each problem, and at the beginning of many of my solutions you'll find my inputs represented by lists (which I generated using the raw input and Notepad++). That said, I'm beginning to learn how to parse my inputs using Python; Day 4 of 2016 is a nice example.

Thanks for taking a look!
